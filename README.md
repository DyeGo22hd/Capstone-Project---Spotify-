## Description:
This Capstone project will concentrate on building a Site/App Interface with its own separate Backend logic for storing and accessing user data (to avoid rate-limit API calls).Extending Spotify services beyond that which is provided by default in Spotify by accessing account details and analytics. For example: Give more accurate song queues based on your current listening session,  auto skips at set timestamps, Spotify wrapped stats at current stage, etc.  Basically, a Spotify wrapper with a lot of added (and technically complex) features.

## Languages
JavaScript, Python, SQL

## Goals
. Create a Site/App for all users to get the full gist of services that Spotify Wrapped or other applications don’t offer. Extend Spotify services beyond that which is provided by default in Spotify by accessing account details and analytics. 

. Manage to create a filter function that prioritizes different options regarding timeline, skipped songs, etc

. In case of completion, initiate more on AudioBooks, Podcasts, etc

## Job Duties 
### Alvi Aziz
Backend Developer (Spotify API Integration, JavaScript) - Responsibilities: Handle Spotify API integration to fetch user data, connect the API with your app, and ensure smooth data flow between Spotify and your system. - Skills/Tools: JavaScript, OAuth for authentication, understanding of Spotify's API documentation. - Focus: Fetching stats (favorite genres, artists, songs, etc.), handling user sessions, ensuring proper API request limits, error handling. 

### Fahid Rahman 
Data Analyst (Python, Data Analysis) - Responsibilities: Analyze Spotify data (e.g., skipped songs, most listened, timestamps). Implement logic for dynamic queues and the most common timestamps for song skips. - Skills/Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy for data analysis), experience with algorithms to determine user behavior patterns. - Focus: Processing the Spotify data, calculating meaningful statistics, creating the recommendation engine for the dynamic queue. 

### Angela Kang 
Frontend/GUI Developer (C++/SQL or Web Dev Frameworks) - Responsibilities: Develop the user interface (UI) of the app/site, either in C++ or using a web development framework (HTML/CSS/JS). This includes designing the pages that show stats and allow users to create custom listening sessions. - Skills/Tools: Web design principles, React (if you choose JavaScript for the frontend), or knowledge of C++ GUI frameworks (e.g., Qt) if you go the app route. - Focus: Ensuring that the user can easily interact with the data and customize their listening experience. 

### Czd Diego Divinagracia
Database Manager (SQL or Storage Architecture) - Responsibilities: Manage data storage, either using SQL databases or file storage based on the app’s needs. Store user stats, session history, and other metadata for quick access and smooth functionality. - Skills/Tools: SQL or relevant database management system, database schema design, data security best practices. - Focus: Efficiently storing and retrieving user data, ensuring scalability, and protecting user information. 


## Market Survey

There’s a big demand for Spotify users to have access to their listening data outside of the annual Spotify Wrapped feature. There are several competitors that customers can use to have insight into their listening data on Spotify and on other platforms such as Apple Music and Tidal. 

### Stats.fm
This is by far the biggest competitor in this space with over 15 million users. The biggest features it has is to share your stats such as your top artist with how many times you streamed it, share your results, and compare your listening habits from different times. They only use Spotify listening data so if a user uses Apple Music or other music platforms, they will not get a comprehensive picture of their listening habits. Stats.fm has a tiered subscription for a lifetime premium membership for $6. 

### Last.fm
The second largest competitor and their main advantage is that they are inclusive of all platforms such as Spotify, Youtube, Apple Music, and Soundcloud. Some of the features they offer is rediscovering old music the user used to listen to, provide weekly reports, and see realtime stats. They offer a premium subscription for $4.99 a month to access additional stats. 

### PlayTally
PlayTally is the biggest competitor for  Apple Music users and it provides extensive data regarding the user’s listening habits such as what time of day they listen to music and has a badge system for achievements. PlayTally’s business model is a one time purchase to buy the app for $2.99 and offers in app purchases for additional features. 

### Voltm.fm 
Volt.fm is targeted for users who only listen on Spotify, but has a small user base and users are dissatisfied with the UI. 
Ultimately, the market survey shows that there is a big demand for users to access their listening data and the main factors that user care about is what music platform the app draws their data from, site reliability, and number of stats available on the app. 

## Main Features
We have a couple of main features that we are going to incorporate for this project:

### Personal Stats
Artist, genres, most searched/listened, skipped

### Overall Trend
Timeline of listening history

### Sharing results
Provide a link for others to see

### Editing/Prioritizing songs in a Dynamic playlist
Editing playlists to prioritize active songs
Dynamic Mode	

### Dynamic Podcast/Audiobook Recommendations

Ensure recommendations based on the max amount on listening to a certain Podcast/Audiobook

## Importance/Motivation

The primary motivation of this project is to allow Spotify users to see comprehensive statistics about their listening history anytime. The process of building an application that can help users quantify their music experience is important because it will expand our collective skillset to actualize a project from conception to deployment.
